This repository contains scripts for creating an execution environment for
executing the libstdc++v3 testsuite directly on base-linux. It draws from
the experience with Genode's run-tool (managing a Genode scenario) as well as
goa (building software for Genode on a Unix host).

As the testsuite is normally embedded within the GCC, we patch the testuite's
configuration in a way that allows to provide our own generated compiler flags,
see 'patches/'. (For the time being, we include a patched version of the
dejagnu framework on which the testsuite is built in the 'contrib' directory.
We only changed the way in which the execution tests are performed as we still
use the 'unix' target of dejagnu that wants to execute the binaries directly.)
In case of base-linux we have to accommodate for providing an execution
environment that runs the test. So we execute the environment with the test
embedded.

The testsuite will be executed sequentially, which may - depending on the
used hardware - take a few hours. You should have at least 1 GiB of free
space in used temp directory available when executing the testsuite and
around 100 MiB in the result directory as the log files are not compressed.
Depending on the amount of failures more space might be need for the log
files.


The following steps give an overview on how to use the script:

# Executing the testsuite

  ./prepare-and-execute -G /home/user/src/genode \
                        -D /home/users/src/genode/depot \
                        -U genodelabs -T /tmp/testsuite \
                        -R /home/user/testsuite-results

The script will exit with an exit-code of 0 it was successful. In case of
failure a non-zero exit-code is returned.


Note the script will automatically update the depot archives before preparing
the execution environment and running the testsuite. Therefore it might be
reasonable to prepare the sources and update depot beforehand, depending on
the test infrastructure, e.g.:

  cd $genode_dir && ./tool/ports/prepare_port libc stdcxx && \
  ./tool/depot/create -j16 UPDATE_VERSIONS=1 FORCE=1 REBUILD= \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/base-linux \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/init \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/libc \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/lx_fs \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/posix \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/stdcxx \
                           genodelabs/bin/x86_64/vfs
